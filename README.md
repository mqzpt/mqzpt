### Hi there 👋

My name is **Matthew Athanasopoulos** and I study **Nanotechnology Engineering at the University of Waterloo!** This degree has given me a broad range of experiences in mathematics, biology, chemistry, electronics, and quantum physics which I enjoy applying in personal and professional projects. I have experience working in engineering and technology part-time, and as a part of full-time internships through my degree, and spend my free time learning about things interesting to me!

- 🏢 I'm currently studying at the **University of Waterloo**
- 🔭 I’m currently working on **blood pressure monitoring at [Olevius](https://olevius-web.vercel.app/)**
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **combinatorial optimization and quantum mechanics**
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **anything I find personally interesting or has a viable business case**
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with **understanding VC funding**
- 💬 Ask me about **physics and financial modeling**

- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm learning Korean!

I began programming to speed up and automate science and engineering tasks, but have since gained experience in Full-Stack development and ML due to personal interests and work experiences. I write TypeScript (React) and Python (FastAPI/Flask) for full-stack development, and am proficient in the PyData stack (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch) as well data viz libraries. I also have taken a few courses in numerical methods leveraging MATLAB and Python for ODE and PDE solvers.
