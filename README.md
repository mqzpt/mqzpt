### Hi there 👋

My name is **Matthew Athanasopoulos** and I study **Nanotechnology Engineering at the University of Waterloo!** This degree has given me a broad range of experinces in mathematics, biology, chemistry, electronics, and quantum physics which I enjoy applying in personal and professional projects. I have experience working in engineering and technology part-time, and as a part of full-time internships through my degree, and spend my free time learning about things interesting to me!

- 🏢 I'm currently studying at the **University of Waterloo**
- 🔭 I’m currently working on **cathode cell engineering @Tesla**
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **combinatorial optimization and quantum mechanics**
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **anything I find personally interesting or has a viable business case**
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with **understanding VC funding**
- 💬 Ask me about **physics and financial modeling**
- 📫 How to reach me: mk2athan@uwaterloo.ca
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm learning Korean!

I often do stuff with programming, often to speed up or automate science or engineering tasks. My programming skills mostly comprise of the PyData stack (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, OpenCV, TensorFlow) and Seaborn, Matplotlib, or Plotly for data visualization. I also have taken a few courses in numerical methods leveraging MATLAB for ODE's/PDE's, but prefer pythonic implementations when possible for easier integration into packages or software.
