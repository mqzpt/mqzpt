### Hi there 👋

My name is **Matthew Athanasopoulos** and I study **Nanotechnology Engineering at the University of Waterloo!** This degree has given me a broad range of experinces in mathematics, biology, chemistry, electronics, and quantum physics which I enjoy applying in personal and professional projects. I have expereince working in engineering and technology part-time, and as a part of full-time internships through my degree, and spend my free time learning about things interesting to me!

- 🏢 I'm currently studying at the **University of Waterloo**
- 🔭 I’m currently working on **data analysis and algorithms for optical devices**
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **combinatorial optimization and quantum mechanics**
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **pretty much anything interesting in the crypto space!**
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with **cythonizing code for my packages**
- 💬 Ask me about **physics and financial modeling**
- 📫 How to reach me: mk2athan@uwaterloo.ca
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm learning Korean!

I sometimes do stuff with programming (which is why this github exists), usually to speed up or automate science or engineering tasks. My programming skills mostly comprise of the PyData stack (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, OpenCV, TensorFlow) and Seaborn, Matplotlib, or Plotly for data visualization. I also have taken a few courses in numerical methods leveraging MATLAB for ODE's/PDE's, but prefer pythonic implementations when possible for easier integration into packages or software.
